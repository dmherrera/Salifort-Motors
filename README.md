# Project Name: Salifort Employee Turnover Prediction

Currently, Salifort is experiencing a high rate of employee turnover, including both voluntary resignations and involuntary terminations. The senior leadership team is concerned about the high turnover rate and its financial impact. Salifort invests significantly in recruiting, training, and upskilling employees, and aims to foster a corporate culture that supports employee success and professional development.

## Project Description

The goal of this project is to predict whether an employee will leave the company and understand the reasons behind their departure. By doing so, Salifort can develop strategies to increase employee retention and job satisfaction, ultimately saving money and time spent on training new employees.

### Objectives:
- **Analyze employee survey data**: Understand the key factors driving employee turnover.
- **Develop predictive models**: Design models to predict employee departure based on job title, department, number of projects, average monthly hours, and other relevant data points.
- **Increase employee retention**: Provide insights and recommendations to help Salifort retain employees and enhance their job satisfaction.

### Approach:
1. **Data Collection**: Human Resources will survey a sample of employees to gather data on factors that might drive turnover.
2. **Data Analysis**: Analyze the survey data to identify patterns and factors contributing to employee turnover.
3. **Model Development**: 
   - Build and evaluate statistical models (e.g., logistic regression).
   - Build and evaluate machine learning models (e.g., decision tree, random forest, XGBoost).
   - Optionally, deploy both statistical and machine learning models to find the most effective approach.
4. **Recommendations**: Share insights and recommendations with the leadership team based on the model's findings.

### Impact:
An effective turnover prediction model will help Salifort:
- Understand why employees leave the company.
- Develop targeted strategies to improve retention and job satisfaction.
- Reduce costs associated with high turnover by retaining more employees and minimizing the need for constant recruitment and training.
